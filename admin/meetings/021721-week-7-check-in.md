## Notes, Decisions, Issues: 
  * Standups
    * four synchronous standups each week sounds good
  * CSS feedback
    * good font choice
  * Notifications
    * good use of default Javascript notifications
    * as long as we get them functioning in the case that notifications are turned on, that's good
  * Branching
    * we could change to a trunk branching structure if we wanted
  * Integration
    * during retrospective think about if we have time to do documentation and testing
    * don't push off documentation and testing
  * UI
    * to test we can use DOM manipulation
