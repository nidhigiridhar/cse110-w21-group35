## Completed Tasks (from previous meeting):

## Pending Business (from previous meeting):

## Notes, Decisions, Issues: 
  * integration: the new method of frequently doing pull requests to sprint 3 branch sounds good
  * documentation:
    * make sure to use the @name, etc. tags for jsdocs
  * timer too slow problem:
    * try updating the interval every 500 or 250 ms instead of 1000 ms so that we're not skipping over a sec
    * in the updateTimer we can use integer division
  * sprint 3 issues:
    * keyboard shortcuts: use S and R
    * delay after start is clicked is fixed
    * background color changes are halfway there (color is hard-coded right now)
  * retrospective
    * our action items look good
    * Chad recommends trying a light version of TDD
  * testing:
    * mash buttons (manual UI testing)
    * end the timer right as the countdown is about to end (race condition)
