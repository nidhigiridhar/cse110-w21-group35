## Completed Tasks (from previous meeting):

## Pending Business (from previous meeting):

## Notes, Decisions, Issues: 
  * Things to think about:
    * research how to do banner notifications
    * explicitly decide the relationship between tasks and timer (can you run timer without having tasks?)
    * think about whether progress bar is necessary
    * think about what to do with timer at the top of beyond MVP wireframe
      * possibly make tasks a retractable side bar
    * do pomodoros carry over from task to task?
  * System diagrams:
    * C4:
      * container diagram - normally, sparse, could include libraries
      * component diagram - include descriptions, how components interact with each other (arrows)
    * create 1 or 2 UML diagrams for the main classes
  * Pipeline:
    * assign 2/3 people to work on pipeline
  * Tasks:
    * need to have reason to implement this
    * make sure it doesn't eat up development time and that users want it
  * Create ADRs for tasks (who owns what, do pomodoros belong to task or vice versa) and breakdown of tasks from project roadmap
  * Project pitch
    * role of tasks and timer
    * target audience - explicitly connect personas to features
    * will take place this weekend (~30 min)
