- Status: accepted
- Deciders: Nidhi Giridhar, Sydney Wong, Jasmine Chen, Alejandro Malanche, Alejandro Marquez, Ian Rebmann, Zachary Chan, Samuel Burkholder
- Date: Sprint 3
## Context and Problem Statement
What keys do we want to use to implement keyboard shortcuts

## Considered Options
- Use s for start and r for reset 
- Use a single key to make it more user friendly 

## Decision Outcome
Chosen options:
- We decided to use the spacebar as the only shorcut since at any given time, only one of the buttons (start/reset) will be enabled. This will also make for a more user friendly experience.
