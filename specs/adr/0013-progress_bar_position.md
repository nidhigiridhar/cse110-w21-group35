- Date: Sprint 3
## Context and Problem Statement
Where should the progress bar be placed on the screen?

## Considered Options
- The dots representing the progress bar are surrounded by a border. This box is placed between the state name and the timer container. 
- The dots (without the border) are placed between the state name and the timer (horizontally).
- The dots (without the border) are placed between the timer and the buttons (horizontally).
- The dots (without the border) are placed on the left side of the timer (vertically).

## Decision Outcome
Chosen options:
- The dots (without the border) are placed between the state name and the timer (horizontally). We took a vote and majority of us agreed on this option.
