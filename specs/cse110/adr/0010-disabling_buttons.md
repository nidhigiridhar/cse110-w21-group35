## Context and Problem Statement
When do we want to enable/disable the start and reset buttons?

## Considered Options
- Leave both buttons enabled at all times.
- Disable reset button when the timer is not running 
- Disbale start button while the timer is counting down
- Disable both buttons during break states.  

## Decision Outcome
Chosen options:
- We decided to disable the reset button when the timer is not running so the user doesn't play around with it and distract themselves. 
- Similarly, we decided to disable the start button when the timer is counting down. 
- We decided to disbale both buttons when the timer is in the break state since it goes against the pomo method to be able to reset a break state.
