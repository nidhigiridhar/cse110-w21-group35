## User story:
As someone who is very familiar with technology and used to navigating using the keyboard, it would be great to have keyboard shortcuts so I can start and reset the timer without using the touchpad. I'd like an audible alarm so that even if I'm not looking at the timer, I know when a pomo is over. The UI should be clean and not too distracting.
